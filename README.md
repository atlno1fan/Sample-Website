This is a sample online ordering system created using PHP, CSS, and HTML. The website has three views which are
- The Admin View: This view allows the admin to manage the store and review recent updates through a dashboard. It allows them to add, update or delete store items as well as manage the user (baristas and registered                   users).
- The Barista View:  This view shows orders awaiting fulfillment. It allows the baristas to track and register which orders got fulfilled and view the items within each order.
- The User View: This view shows the storefront. It allows the user to be able to view all the products as well as make their order.

For more details and a preview of the website and how each view looks. Please check the [user manual PDF](https://github.com/atlno1fan/Sample-Website/blob/main/User%20Manual%20for%20Richiamo.pdf)
